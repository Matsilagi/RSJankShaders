# RSJankShaders
 A set of random / unfitting shaders ported and programmed from Various places, this doesn't fit the criteria for any of my other repos and have way better alternatives, so they will stay here at this repo, instead of the main one. 
 
 If you like what you see, consider dropping a coin at my PayPal at that email: matsilagi2@hotmail.com. Any amount is appreciated.

#### CONTENTS
 The Shaders included here comes from various places, i don't remember where all of them comes from, but here they are:
 -BadBloomPS2: A Shader meant to mimic PS2-era games Bloom, has multiple versions.
 -DitherPS1: A port of ompuco's PS1 Color Quantization and dithering for ReShade.
 -NFSMW: An attempt to port Most Wanted 2005's visual treatment shader. Barely works and is mostly there incase someone wants to fix it or make sense out of it.
 -PipBoy: A monochrome display shader using the color presets from the Fallout 3/New Vegas/4 pipboys.
 -QuakeSky: A depth-based rotating texture replacement meant to mimic Quake 1 non-skybox / portal skies. With the right settings, can look somewhat ish, it just doesn't rotate with the camera.
 -RetroFog: A fog shader meant to mimic Software Doom's sector light mode. Can be made radial or not, quantized and with / without dithering. Meant to be used as some sort of view-limiting shader for its intended effect.
 -Sky Replacer: A test for a sky temperature shader, basically just a knob that changes temperature with depth.
 -TrooCullers: Port of a shader with the same name for GZDoom. It applies and palette and allows for some color control. Might not work on some cases due to texture size limits.
 -UnityAtmosphere: Ported from a Shadertoy, this is meant to mimic Unity's Default Skybox. When bundled with depth and correctly placed, it works as a somewhat ok skybox replacement.
